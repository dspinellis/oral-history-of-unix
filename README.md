## Creation
This repository contains files retrieved from a subset of
[an archived site](https://www.princeton.edu/~hos/Mahoney/)
devoted to Michael Sean Mahoney, Professor of the History of Science at
Princeton University.
They comprise work he did, until his death in summer 2008, to create
[a history of Unix based on interviews with the system's developers](https://www.princeton.edu/~hos/Mahoney/unixhistory.htm).
The files were retrieved on September 29th 2018 and processed to correct
absolute and incorrect hyperlinks.
The creation is documented through this GitHub repository and
the associated `Makefile`, and this `README.md` file.
