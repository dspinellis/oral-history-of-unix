<h3>Building Unix</h3>

<p>Once the group had a machine of its own, its members began to
articulate both the system and the style of computing they had
envisioned from their experience with Multics. Ostensibly in
support of the development of the text processing system for
which the machine had been purchased, they began to forge a
collection of software tools that would come to characterize the
Unix approach to computing. Designed to foster and facilitate
interactive programming, the tools formed the basis of a set of
&quot;Workbenches&quot; that turned Unix into a production
environment for Bell Labs at large. In the process, Unix itself
became as much a toolbox as an operating system. Central to that
toolbox was pipes, a system process that allowed routines to be
linked in sequence, the output of one providing the input for its
successor. According to both McIlroy and Kernighan, pipes created
the concept of tools. So the story of software tools must begin
with the creation of pipes. </p>

<p>As a metaphor, pipes emphasized the notion of tools as filters
or, more technically put, transducers, which transform a sequence
of input symbols into a sequence of output symbols. That notion
fit well with the line of research being pursued by the
theoreticians in Computing Research, most notably Al Aho. As a
result, many of the tools reflected in their conceptual structure
the application of recent results in the theory of automata and
formal languages and in the theory of algorithms. This tie to
theory became another characteristic of the Unix approach to
computing, or the Unix ethos.</p>

<p>Unix was intended to recreate the communal computing
environment that had so impressed the Bell Labs participants in
the Multics project. During the years in which the toolbox took
shape, its creators shared not only a computer system but also a
small attic room, and their physical proximity was often as
important to their collaboration as was the ability to share
files and programs. To understand the economy and efficiency of
the Unix programming environment, one must appreciate the
tight-knit community that created it.</p>

<p>What emerged from the building of Unix was not only, or even
primarily, a text-processing and programming systems that were
the vehicles of its dissemination throughout Bell Labs, AT&amp;T,
and soon the academic community. In its inspiration and
articulation, Unix embodied an ethos of computing, a view of what
computers were for and how they should be used, indeed a view of
how computers could enable and encourage human community.</p>

<p>The sections to follow will begin, then, with the creation of
pipes and the development of some of the basic tools of Unix.
After a look at the theory that informed this work, we will take
a peek at the attic room and the patterns of collaboration that
are embedded in Unix. We will then follow the main lines of its
dissemination to the larger world, starting with the text
processing system that was its initial justification and moving
then to the spread of Unix itself. Finally, we will consider the
ethos that accompanied the software and that made Unix more than
just another operating system.</p>
