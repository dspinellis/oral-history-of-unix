<h2>Computing at Bell Labs through the Eyes of A. G. Fraser</h2>
<h3>Summary by Gordon M. Brown</h3>
<p>
This paper outlines the major themes running though the interview between
Professor Mahoney and A.G. Fraser, head of the Computer System Research
department at Bell Labs.  In the interview, Fraser modestly relates his
role within computing science research at Bell Labs and presents some of
the factors which influenced the development of UNIX.  He begins by
outlining his early work in England and relates the European view of
computing in the 1960s.  Fraser then goes on to explain the role of Multics
and the 1969 Consent Decree in shaping the perception of computer science
at Bell Labs.  He relates this to both the mentality of the programmers
there and to the creation of UNIX .  Through various anecdotes the reader
is treated to an inside view of many of the changes in computing over a 20
year span and is introduced to numerous important (although perhaps
underrated) figures in computer science.  
<p>
	Perhaps it would be prudent to first provide some back-ground
knowledge on Fraser in order to set the stage for his arrival at Bell
Labs. Fraser studied aeronautical engineering at Bristol, England, and
from there he traveled to Cambridge where he received a Ph.D. in computer
science.  It was at Cambridge that Frasers future in computer science was
established.  Here he attended summer courses in Numerical Mathematics,
and worked for the Ferranti corporation.  Ferranti funded the development
of a time sharing system at Cambridge, known as the ATLAS 2,  for which
Fraser helped build the operating system. He notes that in the early 60s
in Cambridge, there existed no computer science department and computing
was treated as a mathematically-oriented side discipline.  As well, most
of the computer research at the time focused on increasing machine
efficiency.  However, ATLAS limited budget and need for integrated system
components began to re-orient research towards programming.  As Fraser
relates, this was also the case at Ferranti, where the initial sales to
commercial establishments had instilled the importance of data
representation and combining file systems with programming languages. 
<p>

	When Fraser arrived at Bell Labs in 1969, he remarks on the
despondent nature of the people there due to the failure of Multics.  This
is significant, for the consequence of this event had a great impact on
the computing mentality at Bell and subsequently influenced the
development of UNIX.  Multics had been a new time sharing system, devised
in conjunction with GE and MIT, to function as the next generation
computer service.  Despite the large investment in Multics, including the
purchase of a new GE-645 to run it, the inability of Multics to meet the
expectations of customers resulted in Bell Labs pulling out of the
project.  There was a great loss of momentum in the computing research
area due to this.  Computer science activities became disassociated from
the rest of Bell Labs and impetus shifted to other areas.   This was
characterized by the loss of computer science personnel to other
departments or research organizations, and the absence of both space and
funding for computer science projects.  For example, Ed David refused to
provide Ken Thompson with a PDP-10 on which he could run UNIX.  Instead,
the initial coding was done on an old PDP-7, which forced the Bell Labs
programmers to be resourceful and creative - attributes which were seen to
become a part of the UNIX system.
<p>
Another of the other main factors influencing Bell Labs at this time was
the Consent Decree of 69.  As a result of an anti-trust case brought
against Bell Labs, the Consent Decree effectively kept the corporation out
of computing.  As Fraser stresses, the legality of minicomputers with
packet switching attributes was constantly called into question, as was
the case with protocol translation.  Subsequently, the fact that UNIX had
both of these characteristics made it a legal hot potato.  Hence, Bell
Labs put UNIX on the back burner, creating the perception that UNIX was
not a legitimate product of the corporation.  For example, when 1127 (the
department headed by Sam Morgan in charge of UNIX) finally received a
computer for systems research, it was placed in the attic - far removed
from the rest of the corporation. This created something of an underground
mentality amongst UNIX programmers and freed them from the time
restrictions and commercial constraints that became commonplace after the
demise of the Consent Decree.
<p>
	This mindset of exploration and innovation was the lodestone for
Bell Labs.  With the loss of so many of the research staff over Multics,
Bell Labs sought to rejuvenate its think-tank with experienced and well
educated people.  As we well know, the focus of this group was to think
both theoretically for the future and practically, for the immediate
commercial interests of the corporation.  This freedom permitted much
experimentation that wasn't in the direct interests of the company.  In
terms of UNIX, this meant creating a system for the programmers
themselves, where access to information was equally important to
information security.  Further, the entrepreneurial mentality and a lack
of time restrictions permitted UNIX to be continually polished and
restructured.  Doug McIlroy had a large role in this, being considered by
Fraser to be a catalyst for the whole program.  The importance McIlroy
placed on the creation of an accurate and comprehensive manual resulted in
programs written well and with an intellectual honesty reflective of works
of literature, not simply lines of code.  Moreover, projects such as
Frasers design aid system refocused computer research on the integration
of system components, marking the shift towards computers as universal
tools. 
<p>
	Although very modest concerning his contributions to UNIX and
computing science in general, Sandy Frasers documentation of the Bell Labs
environment during the creation of UNIX provides valuable insight not only
into UNIX itself, but the creators of UNIX.  More specifically, he
presents how the Consent Decree of 69, along with the failure of Multics,
fostered the creativity and free will that refined the UNIX system and
moved computing science into the age of systems programming.
