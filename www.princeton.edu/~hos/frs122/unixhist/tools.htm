<h3><a name="pipes">The Origin of Pipes</a></h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first edition of Thompson
and Ritchie's <i>The Unix Programmer's Manual</i> was dated
November 3, 1971; however, the idea of pipes is not mentioned
until the Version 3 Unix manual, published in February 1973.
Although Unix was functional without pipes, it was this concept
and notation for linking several programs together that
transformed Unix from a basic file-sharing system to an entirely
new way of computing. The ideas that led to pipes had existed in
various forms long before the concept was formally implemented.
In fact, McIlroy explains that pipes sprang from the earlier use
of macros:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">[I]n the early sixties, Conway wrote an
    article about co-routines. Sixty-three, perhaps in the <i>C[ommunications
    of the] ACM</i>, I had been doing macros, starting back in
    &#145;59 or &#145;60. And if you think about macros, they
    mainly involve switching data streams. You're taking in your
    input, you suddenly come to a macro call, and that says,
    'Stop taking input from here, go take it from the
    definition.' In the middle of the definition, you'll find
    another macro call. So, macros... even as early as
    &#145;64... Somewhere I talked of a macro processor as a
    switchyard for data streams. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aho recalls that McIlroy had developed the concept of pipes
much further:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Doug McIlroy, though, I think is probably
    the author of translation...of pipes. That he had written, I
    think, this unpublished paper when he [was] at Oxford back in
    the &#145;60s....You should read this paper because it's UNIX
    pipes. One of the interesting things about Doug is that he
    has had these great, seminal ideas which not everyone knows
    about. And whether his standards are so high that he doesn't
    publish them...or what? But it's remarkable.... <!--webbot
    bot="PurpleText"
    preview="This is really a different issue, and should be taken up in a section devoted to McIlroy and his management of the project."
    --></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Thompson, the concept of pipes developed as a
result of a combination of ideas from the 940 system, CTSS, and
Multics. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">There were a lot of things that were talked
    about but weren't really done. Like treating files and
    devices the same, you know, having the same read calls.
    Typically during those days there were special calls for the
    terminal and then the file system itself. Those calls weren't
    the same. Confusing them and redirecting I/O was just not
    done in those days. So, that was... I think everyone sort of
    viewed that as a clean concept and the right thing to do, but
    for some reason it just wasn't done. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ritchie is even more willing to acknowledge the contributions
of earlier systems to pipes. To him, &quot;the pipeline is merely
a specific form of co-routine. Even the implementation was not
unprecedented, although we didn't know it at the time; the
&#145;communication files' of the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System
did very nearly what Unix pipes do, though they seem not to have
been exploited so fully.&quot;<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~hos/frs122/unixhist/footnote.htm#footnote_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h4>McIlroy, Thompson, and Pipes</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the concept of pipes
existed in some form long before 1972, it was McIlroy who
advocated an implementation of a pipeline structure into Unix.
From the beginning stages of the project, he had been seeking an
improved method of dealing with input/output structures. &quot;It
was clearly a beautiful mental model, this idea that the output
from one process would just feed in as input to another.&quot;
McIlroy further explains:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">So, this idea had been ironed on in my head
    for a long time....at the same time that Thompson and Ritchie
    were on their blackboard, sketching out their file system, I
    was sketching out on how to do data processing on this
    blackboard, by connecting together cascades of processes and
    looking for a kind of prefix notation language for connecting
    processes together... </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was largely a result of his insistence that pipes was
finally implemented.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Ritchie, McIlroy
later explained the pipeline idea to the Unix team on a
blackboard. However, this did not spark immediate enthusiasm.
There were objections to the notations and the one-input,
one-output command execution structure. <a
href="http://www.princeton.edu/~hos/frs122/unixhist/footnote.htm#footnote_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Nevertheless,
McIlroy succeeded in convincing Thompson to add pipes to Unix.
Thompson explains the difficulty in implementing McIlroy's ideas:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Doug had...talked to us continually about
    it, a notion of interconnecting computers in grids, and
    arrays, you know very complex, you know, and there were
    always problems in his proposals....I mean there's just no
    way to implement his ideas and we kept trying to pare him
    down and weed him down and get him down, you know, and get
    something useful and distill it. What was going on, what was
    needed, what was real ideas, what was the fantasy of
    his...and we ...there were constant discussions all through
    this period, and it hit just one night, it just hit, and they
    went in instantly, I mean they are utterly trivial. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>McIlroy recalls the events a bit differently:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Over a period from 1970 till '72, I would,
    from time to time, say 'How about making something like
    this?', and I would put up another proposal, another
    proposal, another proposal. Then one day I came up with a
    syntax for the shell, that went along with the piping and Ken
    said, 'I'm gonna do it.' He was tired of hearing all this
    stuff...and that was certainly what makes it....That was
    absolutely a fabulous day, the next day too. 'I'm gonna do
    it.' He didn't do exactly what I had proposed for the pipe
    system call. He invented a slightly better one, that finally
    got changed once more to what we have today. He did use my
    clumsy syntax... </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, pipes used the same
syntax as redirection (&lt; and &gt;). However, this proved to be
cumbersome, as several different combinations could represent the
same command. Just before a presentation in London, Thompson
decided to replace McIlroy's syntax with the vertical bar,
eliminating the ambiguities of the old syntax. As Kernighan
recalls, &quot;I remember the preposterous syntax, that
&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; or whatever syntax, that somebody came up
with, and then all of a sudden there was the vertical bar, and
just [snaps fingers] everything clicked at that point.&quot; The
beauty of the structure that McIlroy once described as
&quot;garden hoses&quot; was recognized; data would simply flow
from one program to another.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, the notation and
syntax of pipes were just as important as the concept itself;
pipes might not have been so successful without this further
distinction from redirection. As Aho recalls, the full
implications of pipes gradually developed after this:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">I really didn't appreciate the significance
    of what you could do with it, at the time, in the &#145;60s.
    And I don't think anyone did, because...what made a lot of
    this philosophy...a lot of these tools go was the framework
    that Unix provided. That you could have pipes on which you
    could take the output of one program, and transmit it as
    input to another program. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kernighan explains why pipes was a superior method of
input/output:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">It's not that you couldn't do those kind of
    things, because I had already written redirection; it
    predates pipes by a noticeable amount. Not a tremendous
    amount, but it definitely predates it. That's an oldish idea.
    That's enough to do most of the things that you currently do
    with pipes; it's just not notationally anywhere near so
    convenient. I mean, it's sort of loosely analogous to working
    with Roman numerals instead of Arabic numerals. It's not that
    you can't do arithmetic, it's just a bitch. Much more
    difficult, perhaps, and therefore mentally...more
    constraining. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pipes went far beyond McIlroy's original goal of creating a
new I/O mechanism; the programmers used pipes to send an output
of one program to the input of another. As Kernighan explains:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">That was the time, then, I could start to
    make up these really neat examples [of pipe commands] that
    would show things like doing, you know, running <code>who</code>,
    and collecting the output in a file, and then word counting
    the file to say how many users there were, and then saying,
    'Look how much easier it is with...[piping] the <code>who</code>
    into the word count, and running <code>who</code> into <code>grep</code>,'
    and starting to show combinations that were things that were
    never thought of, and yet they were so easy that you could
    just compose them at the keyboard and get them right every
    time. That's, I think, when we started to think, probably
    consciously, about tools, because then you could compose the
    things together if you had made them so that they actually
    worked together. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was the pipes concept that allowed the notion of the
software toolbox to develop. When interviewed by Mahoney, McIlroy
insisted that pipes &quot;not only reinforced, [but] almost
created&quot; the toolbox.</p>

<h4><a name="tools">Software Tools</a></h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step in developing
what would come to be known as the software toolbox was to ensure
that all programs could read from the standard input. McIlroy
explains the problem, and its solution:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Most of the programs up until that time
    couldn't take standard input, because there wasn't the real
    need. They had file arguments. <code>grep</code> had a file
    argument, <code>cat</code> had a file argument. Thompson saw
    that that wasn't going to fit into this scheme of things, and
    he went in and changed all those programs in the same night.
    I don't know how. In the next morning we had this orgy of
    'one-liners.' Everybody had one-liner. 'Look at this, look at
    that.' </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kernighan elaborates with an example:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">And that's when people went back and
    consciously put into programs the idea that they read from a
    list of files, but if there were no files they read from the
    standard input, so that they could be used in pipelines.
    People went back and did that consciously in programs, like <code>sort</code>.
    <code>Sort</code>--an example of a program that cannot work
    in a pipeline, because all the input has to be read before
    any output comes out--it doesn't matter, because you're going
    to use it in a pipeline, right? And you don't care whether it
    piles up there briefly; it's going to come out the other end.
    It's that kind of thing, where we say, 'Hey, make them work
    together. Then they become tools.' Somewhere in there, with
    the pipes, and maybe somewhere the development of <code>grep</code>--which
    Ken did, sort of overnight--the quintessential tool, as I
    guess Doug refers to it. A thing which, in a different
    environment probably you don't see it that way. But, in the
    Unix environment you see it as the basic tool, in some sense.
    </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>grep</code> was, in fact, one of the first programs that
could be classified as a software tool. Thompson designed it at
the request of McIlroy, as McIlroy explains:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">One afternoon I asked Ken Thompson if he
    could lift the regular expression recognizer out of the
    editor and make a one-pass program to do it. He said yes. The
    next morning I found a note in my mail announcing a program
    named <code>grep</code>. It worked like a charm. When asked
    what that funny name meant, Ken said it was obvious. It stood
    for the editor command that it simulated, g/re/p (global
    regular expression print)....From that special-purpose
    beginning, <code>grep</code> soon became a household word.
    (Something I had to stop myself from writing in the first
    paragraph above shows how firmly naturalized the idea now is:
    'I used <code>ed</code> to <code>grep</code> out words from
    the dictionary.') More than any other single program, <code>grep</code>
    focused the viewpoint that Kernighan and Plauger christened
    and formalized in <i>Software Tools</i>: make programs that
    do one thing and do it well, with as few preconceptions about
    input syntax as possible. </font><a
    href="http://www.princeton.edu/~hos/frs122/unixhist/footnote.htm#footnote_3"><font size="2"><sup>3</sup></font></a><font
    size="2"> </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of specialized programs
was carried even further with the development of <code>eqn</code>,
a mathematical text formatter developed by Kernighan and Cherry.
Kernighan explains how <code>eqn</code> developed:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">[T]here was a graduate student named [name
    deleted] who had worked on a system for doing mathematics,
    but had a very different notion of what it should be. It
    basically looked like function calls. And so, although it
    might have worked, he a) didn't finish it, I think, and b)
    the model probably wasn't right. I remember, he and Lorinda
    had worked on it, or she had been guiding him, or something
    like that. I looked at and I thought, 'Gee, that seems wrong,
    there's got to be a better way to say it.' I mean, then
    suddenly I drifted into this notion of, do it the way you say
    it. I don't know where that came from, although I can
    speculate. I had spent a fair length of time, maybe a couple
    of years, when I was a graduate student, at Recording for the
    Blind, at Princeton. I read stuff like computing reviews and
    scattered textbooks of one sort or another, so I was used to
    at least speaking mathematics out loud. Conceivably, that
    trigged some kind of neurons. I don't know. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>eqn</code> was an important software tool because,
according to Kernighan, it 'was the first--something that sat on
top of, or in front of, a formatter to genuinely broaden what you
could do with them.' <code>eqn</code> went a step beyond <code>grep</code>;
not only was it a small program that served one function, but it
served little purpose without being tied to another program
through a pipeline.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>eqn</code> and <code>grep</code>
are illustrative of the Unix toolbox philosophy that McIlroy
phrases as, &quot;Write programs that do one thing and do it
well. Write programs to work together. Write programs that handle
text streams, because that is a universal interface.&quot; This
philosophy was enshrined in Kernighan and Plauger's 1976 book, <i>Software
Tools</i>, and reiterated in the &quot;Foreword&quot; to the
issue of <i>The Bell Systems Technical Journal</i> that also
introduced pipes. <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~hos/frs122/unixhist/footnote.htm#footnote_4"><sup>4</sup> </a>By
the time these were published in the late 1970s, software tools
were such an integral part of Unix that one could hardly imagine
the operating system without them. As Kernighan explains:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">People would come in and they'd say, 'Yeah,
    this is nice, but does the system do X?' for some X, and the
    standard answer for all of this was, 'No, but it's easy to
    make it do it.' Unix has, I think for many years, had a
    reputation as being difficult to learn and incomplete.
    Difficult to learn means that the set of shared conventions,
    and things that are assumed about the way it works, and the
    basic mechanisms, are just different from what they are in
    other systems. Incomplete means, because it was meant as a
    program development environment, it doesn't have all the
    finished products necessarily. But, as a program development
    environment, it's very easy to build a lot of these things.
    It's sort of like a kit. And if you want a new thing, you can
    take the pieces out of the kit and assemble them to make your
    new thing, rather more rapidly than you would be able to do
    the same thing in some other kind of environment. So, we used
    to say that. 'Does it do X?' 'No, but it's real easy. Do you
    want one by tomorrow? I'll give you one by tomorrow.' </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the software tools concept solidified, there was an
increased interest among Unix programmers in developing a wider
variety of specialized tools, and in developing them more
quickly. </p>

<h4>Little Languages</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of tools was extended
to include the idea that people would actually use tools to
develop other tools. Thus, the Unix programmers developed highly
specialized scripting tools that became known as &quot;little
languages.&quot; Kernighan explains how the concept of little
languages developed for him:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Somewhere, somebody asked me to give a
    talk. I looked back and realized that there was, in some way,
    a unifying theme to a lot of the ways that I had been fooling
    around over the years, which is that I had been building
    languages to make it easy to attack this, that, or the other
    problem. In some way, make it easy for somebody to talk to
    the machine. I started to count them up, and, gee, there were
    a lot of things there that were languages. Some of them were
    absolutely conventional things, some of them were
    pre-processors that sat on other things, some were not much
    more than collections of subroutines; but, you know, you
    could sort of call them languages. And they were all
    characterized by being relatively small, as they were things
    that were done by one or two people, typically. And they were
    all not mainstream; I never built a C compiler. They were
    attacking sort of off-the-wall targets. So, I said, gee,
    well, they're little languages. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the broad definition given by Kernighan, software
tools such as <code>eqn</code>, <code>tbl</code>, and <code>make</code>
can be considered little languages. Scripting languages are also
little languages because they simplify tasks that would otherwise
become complex under a full-scale language such as C. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such scripting language, <code>awk</code>,
was developed by Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Kernighan to be used
for &quot;simple one or two-line programs to do some filtering as
part of a larger pipeline.&quot;<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~hos/frs122/unixhist/footnote.htm#footnote_5"><sup>5</sup></a>
The modern language <code>perl</code>, a prominent scripting
language used on the World Wide Web, is a descendant of <code>awk</code>.
Kernighan explains the origins of <code>awk</code>: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">We had this thing called <code>qed</code>....It
    was a programmable editor, but it was programmable in some
    formal sense. It was just awful, and yet it was the only
    thing around that let you manipulate text in a program
    without writing a hell of a lot of awkward code. So I was
    interested in programmable editors, things that would let you
    manipulate text with somewhat the same ease that you can
    manipulate numbers. I think that that was part of my interest
    in <code>awk</code>. The other thing is--that I remember as a
    trigger for me--was a very, very specialized tool that a guy
    named Mark Rochkind developed....He had a program that would
    let you specify basically a sequence of regular expression
    and message...and then it would create a program such that,
    if you pass data through this program, when it's an instance
    of the regular expression, it would print the message. And
    we'd use it for data validation. And I thought, what a neat
    idea! It is a neat idea. It's a really elegant idea. It's a
    program that creates a program that then goes off and
    validates data, and you don't have to put all the baggage in.
    Some program creates the baggage for you. The only problem
    with it was that it was specialized, this one tiny
    application. And so my contribution to <code>awk</code>, if
    you like, is the notion that you can generalize this. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Weinberger explains that one of the main purposes of <code>awk</code>
was to improve the database capabilities of Unix: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">So we sat around and talked about this
    stuff and there's roughly speaking two pieces to databases.
    One is the question of how you get stuff out of the database.
    And the other is the question of how you sort of put stuff
    into the database. And putting stuff into a database gets
    involved in these &#145;are we going to allow for concurrent
    transactions?' and &#145;do we have to do locking?' because
    Unix was not particularly good...was incapable of in those
    days. And it was just all too weird. Eventually we settled on
    the idea of what we wanted was some...tool that would let you
    get stuff out of ordinary Unix files in a way that was...more
    general, more useful, more database-like, more report
    generally like. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>awk</code> used a regular expression matching function
similar to <code>grep</code>, but greatly expanded on it by
adding the ability to replace the original expressions with the
desired data stream. </p>

<h4><a name="attic">The Attic</a></h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might have been more
difficult for the Unix programmers to develop software tools as
quickly as they did had they been working in a different
environment. The center of Unix activity was a sixth-floor room
at Murray Hill which contained the PDP-11 that ran Unix.
&quot;Don't think of a fancy laboratory, but it was a room up in
the attic,&quot; as Morris describes it. In addition to the
programmers, four secretaries from the patent department worked
in the attic, performing the text-processing tasks for which Unix
was ostensibly developed. Morris describes the environment:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">We all worked in the same room. We worked
    all up in an attic room on the sixth floor, in Murray Hill.
    In space that maybe was one and a half times the size of this
    hotel room. We were sitting at adjacent terminals, and
    adjacent, and we knew each other and we always in fact ate
    lunch together. Shared a coffeepot. So, it was a very close
    relationship and most of us were both users and contributors
    and there was a significant initiative for research
    contribution at all points. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The unique working conditions of the programmers led to a free
exchange of ideas and complete access to information. Moreover,
the close-knit environment led to certain standards of etiquette
among the programmers. Cherry gives an example:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">[T]here was this attitude that he who
    touched it last owned it. So if you needed <code>pr</code> to
    do something <code>pr</code> didn't do, and you went and
    added it, you now owned <code>pr</code>. And so if some other
    part of it broke, you owned it. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the additional responsibilities that resulted from
changing a tool, the programmers did not hesitate to make any
improvements they deemed necessary. For example, Morris modified <code>pr</code>,
as he explains:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">I remember, for example, one piece of
    software that I made a noticeable change in. I was listening
    one day in about 1974 to Ken and Dennis arguing about when
    something happened, and even at that point they couldn't
    agree to the nearest year it happened. They had a printout in
    front of them which had the date on it--month and day of the
    month. And I looked at them, looked at the piece of paper,
    their argument, and in my best Southern drawl I said, 'Ah
    shit,' and turn around [to the] console and actually changed
    the print programming program called <code>pr</code> and so
    it would now print out the year. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Morris greatly appreciated the fact that tools were easy to
use and fix, even fixing problems before they were vocalized.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">One day early on--let me pick about 1973--I
    was watching Dennis Ritchie do some arithmetic computations.
    I don't mean anything fancy. He was just adding up a list of
    numbers, using <code>dc</code> to do it, and as he was typing
    them in he made a error of typing, and <code>dc</code> for no
    particular reason except just the way it was designed--it
    could have just printed him an error comment, but that's not
    what it did--it printed him an error comment and wiped out
    the current sum. So, he had to start from scratch, and [I]
    again went back to my favorite Southern drawl. Went in made
    the change to the first program of <code>dc</code>.
    Recompiled it and installed it and it when about ten minutes
    later. Dennis, who probably hadn't seen me, the fact that I
    was watching him, said, 'There's a problem with your program
    and think I ought to fix it.' 'Hey, it's already installed.'
    And that kind of thing could happen with any person, any
    software, any time and was the rule rather than the
    exception. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This example illustrates how the open, cooperative environment
in the attic improved the responsiveness and flexibility of the
system. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, each
programmer used all of the tools himself, and thus could correct
and enhance them in ways that would not have been possible in a
different environment. As Morris explains, no person involved in
the project could be a user without being a programmer.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">I was a user and I was creating [a] system
    that in part, in large parts I wanted to use. So, the parts I
    was creating were in many cases the part I needed for my own
    work. So, I was both a user and a contributor. But, that was
    generally true. It was true of everyone. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He specifically discusses his calculator program, <code>dc</code>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Though I didn't write [<code>dc</code>] for
    the public, I wrote it for myself and that&#146;s true of a
    lot of software that people are by and large writing software
    according to their own standards. The way they wanted to. For
    their own use, and the use of their friends and associates. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, Kernighan believes that no one could be a
programmer in Unix without being a user of the system.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">We use our own stuff, and I think that's a
    critical observation about this group here. We do not build

    <p><font size="2">If I build something for you, even if you
    spend a lot of time describing to me what you want, and why
    it's the way it is, it's not going to be as successful as
    something where I personally face the problems. Now, I may
    live with you long enough that I start to understand what
    your problems are, and then I'll probably do a better job,
    but I think that we have historically done the best on
    building things that address problems that we face ourselves.
    That we understand them so well because we face them, either
    directly--you know, I face that problem myself--or it's the
    person in the next office. </font></p>
