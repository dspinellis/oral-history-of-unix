<h2 align="left">Finding a Machine </h2>

<h4 align="left">Darice Wong and Jake Knerr</h4>

<p>After Multics' cancellation in March of 1969, essentially no
department was allowed to buy a computer powerful enough to
continue Multics research. Sam Morgan became the department head
of computing science research at Bell Labs in 1967, well into the
Multics program. He was present during the cancellation of
Multics and the birth of Unix. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">There was an announcement, a formal
    announcement that the work was stopping, that we were
    [devoting] no more effort to [Multics], and that we were
    simply out of it. I believe it had to be done that way
    because ... unless there is a definite statement that you are
    not going to work on a project anymore, why, some people will
    continue to work on it. That's the way... research goes. Folk
    from day to day do their own thing. And so there was a clear
    announcement that the work was over...It was simply... using
    up effort and was not... advancing and showed no promise
    of... turning into a user useful thing. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A number of factors contributed to AT&amp;T's decision to not
buy any more computers powerful enough to run Multics. As Sam
Morgan was able to recount about the removal of service computing
from all technical organizations in Bell Labs in the middle of
1969: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">... service computing at all Bell Labs
    locations ... merged into a single division under a man named
    Phil Thayer... All the comp centers were put under unified
    management and for a year and a half I was both Director of
    Service Computing at Murray Hill and Whippany, and Director
    of Computing Science Research. ... It just wasn't reasonable
    ... for a research organization also to try to manage a
    stable computing center. So anyhow, having a separate
    computing service organization was long overdue. [The
    separate computing organization] was started in the middle of
    1969. And this was another impetus I think toward the
    development of an operating system for small machines, namely
    Unix, that went on in computing science research. Because
    once the comp center machines were moved out from under the
    research aegis, we had in research had our own machines, and
    management would not buy big DEC PDP 10's and so we had to do
    something on minicomputers. And that was another impetus
    toward Thompson and Richie in the Unix direction. Anyway,
    that's, that's kind of the history of things. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many scientists did not understand, or did not want to
understand, that AT&amp;T was out of computers. Thompson in
particular recalls, &quot;There was no explicit policy that we
weren't going to get back into the computer business&quot; </p>

<p>Thompson and Ritchie began work on a Multics like file system
because they enjoyed using Multics, as didmost of the scientists,
and wanted to continue research. Sam Morgan felt that scientists
liked Multics because &quot;[Multics] was fun. You could develop
software, you could do all sort of things with it. It just wasn't
... cost effective.&quot; Because the writers of Unix liked the
type of environment Multics provided, when Unix was developed, it
&quot;turned out to be a much simpler, more cost effective
environment which provided users with the pleasures of... the
same kind of sandbox,&quot; the best of both worlds. Thompson and
Ritchie were determined to find a computer to continue
Multics-like research. What they found was an aging DEC PDP-7,
the only system available. It had a very limited memory but at
least they could implement a file system. </p>

<p>The PDP-7 in question was specially equipped for fancy
graphics work being done by Bill Minkey. It belonged to
department 13, headed by Joseph Condon, an electrical engineer
who worked on current flow. Condon's group wasn't using the
computer, and Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie were fooling around
with it. They even programmed a famous computer game, &quot;Space
Travel&quot;. Sam Morgan noted &quot;that Ken Thompson had a
space war game that he played for a while when he was looking for
something to replace Multics.&quot; </p>

<p>When asked how Thompson and Ritchie were using a computer not
in their department, Condon said, &quot;I don't know.&quot; In
fact, Condon had become the head of the department that owned the
PDP-7 after Thompson and Ritchie began borrowing the machine.
Thompson explains how it happened:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">It was another department that owned it,
    and when it would break, it would be a hassle over who
    maintained it, and we didn't maintain it because we couldn't
    get our department to pay for maintenance. There was... no
    money ...[and] they just didn't want us to do this. ... this
    department that owned the machine ... wanted to throw it
    away, but [we wanted] to keep it, on their space and maintain
    it for [ourselves]. That was a precarious situation, and that
    persisted. Then when it became clear that these machines were
    nearing the end of their life, we ... tried to get them
    officially ours, which failed, our manager wouldn't pick up
    these machines, at zero cost, you know, they didn't
    want...the cost of the space. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Thompson realized that the PDP-7 was not powerful enough
to implement a file system that could offer some of the
advantages of Multics he initially programmed a bare-bones file
system. The file system was then put on a PDP-10. Using this
enhanced capability, Thompson and the others slowly added tools
that helped them monitor what the file system was doing. Thompson
devoted a month apiece to the shell, editor, assembler, and other
software tools. When asked when he realized that a new operating
system was being born, Thompson replied, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">... in the summer of '69, it was totally
    rewritten in a form that looked like an operating system,
    with tools that were sort of known, you know, assembler,
    editor, and shell -- if not maintaining itself, right on the
    verge of maintaining itself, to totally sever the GECOS
    connection. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was this point that the epic birth of UNIX became a
reality. After the OS was implemented in assembly language it was
dubbed UNIX as a play on Multics; MULTI- being many and UNI-
being one. </p>

<p>The file system on the PDP-7 was created in assembly language.
As noted above, Thompson realized that for an operating system to
be useful it needed to be created in a high-level programming
language by which it could be ported to any system. Thompson
initially began programming a Fortran compiler, but changed his
mind and created a very simple language called B. Ritchie
improved upon B and renamed the language C. UNIX was written in C
and could be ported to any computer. </p>

<p>Because of its portability, Unix could now be tried on a
larger machine. The only trouble was finding a machine around the
size of Multics and a department head to purchase it. Thompson
was able to recall the process. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">... we started on a set of proposals for
    getting a new machine,...... So what would happen was that we
    would take these proposals for these machines and do all the
    research on them and get the vendors in and waste everybody's
    time, and get these proposals up and they'd be thought about
    our management for a extended periods of time and they'd say
    'no' for some funny reason, you know, never for a real one
    (unclear) computing anymore. There were several, really
    several, of these big rounds of trying to get a vendor and a
    machine and, to get....to do this work. Most of it was
    carried on by Osanna and me, and the interference type
    people. Ultimately what happened was um we found a PDP-11, it
    was in fact not announced yet, but it was right on the edge
    of being announced. ...Osanna and I put together a proposal
    to buy a PDP-11 to do ... research in text processing,
    (unclear) and document preparation, ... it was the first of
    the goals that were specific, ... The other ones were...we
    wanted to play with computers and operating systems, and they
    were unspecific, and the our management went off and thought
    about it, and rejected it again. But in the meantime going up
    and down the hierarchy a sister department, 122, psychology
    research, came over and said 'well we'll fund it out of our
    area,' embarrassed the hell out of our management. And they
    bought it, gave it to us, and...They just had Insight, and
    inspiration and unfortunately our management didn't.... our
    management was suffering from wounds from the Multics days. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eventually, Lee McMahon, one of the four members of the Unix
machine proposal group, the only one who belonged to another
department, convinced his own department head to fund a machine. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Joe Osanna convinced the Bell Labs patent office
that Unix would be a worthwhile investment as a text processing
system. Use of Unix started in the patent office of Bell Labs,
but by 1972 there were a number of non-research organizations at
Bell Labs that were beginning to use Unix for software
development. Morgan recalls the importance of text processing in
the establishment of Unix. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">[Space Travel] was fun but the, the first
    real application of the file system that became Unix was a
    text processing system. And this was kind of the merging of
    file system work and work that folks had been interested in
    for a long time, text processing... </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">People were interested in text editing and
    formatting and you could do this on a small computer... if
    you had an operating system that involved easy handling of
    files and... time sharing, ... people could access and use
    each other's files. The Unix file system and the text editing
    and formatting work kind of came together... </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">[A text processing system] was a system the
    Labs was willing to buy a machine for. When this, the
    proposal was first made that we should buy a machine for text
    processing it was presented to me because I had to sign the
    purchase order. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though in afterthought Morgan admits to the merits of text
processing, he had this defense to his initial rejection: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">[T]he pitch was not really that two of
    Morgan's MTS, having been thrown out of Morgan's office (I
    exaggerate here, but having been thrown out of Morgan's
    office), trot down the hall to Matthew's and say, 'Morgan
    doesn't love us what can you do for us?' They came in through
    McMahon's director ...The people who originally made the
    proposition to me were Osanna, Thompson and McMahon, who were
    working together. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Morgan admits to his underestimation of the proposals but,
acting as a department head, his responsibility was to rely on
what he knew, which wasn't much about text processing. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">I didn't understand at the time the
    innovative nature of the Unix file system, and we had done
    text processing work in the past and I didn't see that we
    were, that any great research advance was being made. It
    sounded as if people wanted to provide a service or something
    with a typing pool. So the first proposal to buy a, I guess
    it was a PDP1120 I turned down...As I said the first time
    that Thompson and company asked for a computer they asked for
    a DEC PDP10 and they were told no on that. It was simply too
    big and you are not going to do operating system research for
    a big computer just after Multics has been turned off. The
    second time they asked, they wanted a PDP-1120 and I said, 'I
    am not convinced yet, I want to see more of what you say you
    are going to do with your text processing system.' </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In any event, his philosophy followed a somewhat lax path. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I<font size="2"> didn't stomp on them, but neither did I
    sign their order and they found somebody else, another
    director to sign the order, and the third time they came
    around they wanted an 11/45 and by that time they had a
    perfectly plausible and defensible story. So they got
    selective enthusiasm used on them but not too violently or
    with too short of a time scale. If it is going to be good it
    will prove itself. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of Morgan's problems with accepting the proposals was in
dealing with his own management and the bureaucracy in the upper
levels of Bell Labs. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">well I guess I had some difficulty in
    sorting out the signal from the noise. I was quite well aware
    that my bosses wouldn't approve the purchase of a really
    large computer to support any surreptitious continuation of
    the Multics effort. And I was I think willing to wait for the
    initial shouting to die down, and I figured that if there was
    a research component involved in the text processing work
    that it would appear in due course. And indeed it did. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being a manager, Morgan had rules of management to follow. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">The management principles here are that you
    hire bright people and you introduce them to the environment,
    and you give them general directions as to what sort of thing
    is wanted, and you give them lots of freedom. Doesn't mean
    you always necessarily give them all the money that they
    want. ...You exercise selective enthusiasm over what they do.
    And if you mistakenly discourage or fail to respond to
    something that later on turns out to be good, if it is really
    a strong idea it will come back... </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To Morgan, his decision and the effects of his decision were a
natural process, and there was nothing to regret. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">I have never been in an organization that
    had enough money, or enough hiring slots, or enough office or
    land space to do everything that we would like to do. So one
    provides some back pressure. And in the case of the
    transition from Multics to Unix, the Multics faucet had to be
    turned off reasonably hard. It was a part of turning off, I
    mean it was a management decision that this was going to be
    turned off. And part of turning it off was not immediately
    buying hardware on which Multics could be continued. In
    retrospect, Thompson and Ritchie and other people did find
    partly through their own efforts and partly by looking for a
    director that was willing to buy a small amount of hardware,
    did find machines on which they could work. And in due course
    when it was clear to everybody around the research area that
    Unix was going to go somewhere and needed to be supported,
    they have had the machines that they wanted. They simply went
    to the director of the other person in the trio. And I didn't
    think there was anything wrong with this or unreasonable
    about it. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was a reasonable justification for the way things
eventually worked out. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Max Matthews was a person who collected
    little computers anyway, and it may be that he had more money
    at the time than I did. We have certain plant budgets.
    Anyway, I didn't think that there was anything out of the way
    about this and I didn't feel that somebody was criticizing my
    judgment. Max was perhaps in a better position to support the
    machine, or I don't know what. But anyway it didn't seem
    unusual to me, and now that I recall McMahon reported to me
    for a long time. He transferred from Max's organization into
    mine not too long after this particular incident. But at the
    time he was a department head for Max Matthews. So he added
    his voice to the desires that the other fellows had and so
    Max bought the first computer. But there was nothing, there
    was nothing particularly unusual about this. And since it
    would have been a little more unusual if people entirely from
    one center had gone to a different director and said, 'Can
    you support this?' In which case, I am sure that Max would
    have come to me and said, 'Look, two of your guys have come
    to me and have said, will I buy them a computer? If a
    computer is going be bought, you ought to buy it. Let's
    discuss whether it should be bought or not.' The reason it
    didn't happen that way was that one of Max's department heads
    was in this story. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Morgan's view, Matthews' department was a better choice for
supporting the funding of a new machine than his own. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">I was told, 'Look, Max Matthews can support
    this.' He was the other director. And why could he support
    it? He could support it because he was interested in text
    processing. He was doing, ... he was in behavioral sciences
    and psychology, and he had people who were working on text
    processing, and in fact one of the folk who was, came in with
    the proposition for the 11/20 that I turned down. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fraught with difficulties, the search for a machine came to a
successful end. Though Thompson and his fellow Unix programmers
eventually obtained a PDP-11/45, the PDP7, the machine that was
too small, was integral in the way Unix developed. Had the PDP-7
not been available, history might have been different. </p>
